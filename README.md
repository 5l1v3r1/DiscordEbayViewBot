# Getting Started
1. To get started, first you should download and install Python. You can do this either through the website or through the .exe installer I have included in this project.
  - NOTE: WHEN INSTALLING PYTHON MAKE SURE YOU DO THE ADVANCED INSTALL AND CHECK THE OPTION TO ADD TO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (MAY BE LABELLED AS AN OPTION TO ADD TO PATH).
2. Secondly, double click the `Setup.bat` file in order to install the necessary libraries for the project.
3. Next, you need to go into `Config.yml` and follow the comments in that file in order to configure your settings for the bot.
4. Once you have done all of the steps above, double click `Start.bat` to run the bot.

# Notes
1. This bot is very simple, is may be patched with a slightly safer system in the future.
  - Users right now are able to spam the bot, this would be rate limited.
2. The included python installer is built for Windows, it will not work on any other operating systems.
3. Also, the `.bat` files that I told you to run will only work on Windows. For running on other systems, you can either reach out to me personally or figure it out yourself.

# Potential Updates:
- [ ] Adding support for proxies (configurable in Config.yml)
- [x] Adding rate limiting (Person can only run one set at a time, then has a cooldown before they can run more views.)
